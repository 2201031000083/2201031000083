            A kidney is a bean-shaped organ located in the lower abdomen, just
            below the rib cage. Each kidney is about the size of a fist and
            weighs approximately 130 grams. The kidneys have a vital role in the
            body as they are responsible for filtering blood, producing urine,
            and maintaining the balance of electrolytes, water, and waste
            products. The kidneys are made up of millions of tiny filtering
            units called nephrons.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line8">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="each-nephron-filters">
            Each nephron filters blood and removes waste products, excess water,
            and electrolytes. The filtered blood and waste products then flow
            into the ureters, which are tubes that connect the kidneys to the
            bladder.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line9">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-urine-then">
            The urine then flows into the bladder and is stored until it is
            released through the urethra during urination. The kidneys also play
            a role in regulating blood pressure, maintaining.

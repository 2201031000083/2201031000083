            The female reproductive system is a complex network of organs and
            glands that work together to produce, nourish, and transport a baby
            from conception to birth. The main organs of the female reproductive
            system include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and
            mammary glands.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line14">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-ovaries-are">
            The ovaries are small, almond-shaped organs located on either side
            of the uterus. They are responsible for producing and releasing eggs
            (oocytes) during the menstrual cycle, as well as producing hormones
            such as estrogen and progesterone.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line15">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-fallopian-tubes">
            The fallopian tubes are two thin tubes that extend from the upper
            corners of the uterus and are connected to the ovaries. They are
            responsible for transporting the egg from the ovary to the uterus.
            Fertilization of the egg by a sperm typically occurs in the
            fallopian tubes.

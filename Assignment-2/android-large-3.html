            The lungs are a pair of organs located in the chest cavity that are
            responsible for breathing. They are part of the respiratory system,
            which also includes the nose, throat, windpipe, and diaphragm. The
            lungs are spongy and have a light pink color, and they are protected
            by the ribcage.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-right-lung">
            The right lung is divided into three lobes, while the left lung has
            two lobes. This asymmetry is due to the presence of the heart on the
            left side of the body. The lungs are covered by a thin membrane
            called the pleura, which helps to protect them and allows them to
            move smoothly during breathing.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line1">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-lungs-are1">
            The lungs are constantly working to provide the body with the oxygen
            it needs to function. On average, a person takes about 16-20 breaths
            per minute, which adds up to about 20,000 breaths per day. It is
            important to take care of your lungs by avoiding smoking and
            exposure to pollutants.

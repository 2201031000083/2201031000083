            The pancreas is a gland located in upper abdomen, tucked behind the
            stomach and close to the gallbladder, liver, and small intestine. It
            is both an exocrine gland and an endocrine gland. As an exocrine
            gland, it produces digest juices that contain enzymes to help break
            down food in the small intestine. These juices flow down a tube
            called the pancreatic duct, which connects with the common bile duct
            and empties into the duodenum, the first part of the small
            intestine.

          <p class="the-endocrine-system">
             The endocrine system of the pancreas consists of glands that
            hormones into your blood, controlling many of your body’s functions.
            The pancreas produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon that
            control blood sugar. It is located behind the stomach and in front
            of the spine, and is about 6 inches long. The pancreas can be
            affected by various conditions, including diabetes, pancreatitis,
            and pancreatic cancer.

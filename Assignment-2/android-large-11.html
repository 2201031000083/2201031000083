            The male reproductive system is a group of organs that are involved
            in sexual function and the production of offspring in men or people
            assigned male at birth. The system includes both external and
            internal parts. The external organs include the penis, scrotum, and
            testicles, while the internal organs include the vas deferens,
            prostate, and urethra. These organs work together to produce, store,
            and transport sperm, which can fertilize an egg produced by the
            female reproductive system.Â

          <p class="the-penis-is">
            The penis is the male organ used for sexual intercourse, it has
            three parts: the root, the body or shaft, and the glans, which is
            the cone-shaped part at the end of the penis. The glans, also known
            as the head of the penis, is covered with a loose layer of skin
            called the foreskin. The scrotum is a sac-like pouch that hangs
            behind the penis and contains the testicles, nerves, and blood
            vessels.

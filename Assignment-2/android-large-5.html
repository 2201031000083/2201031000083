            The liver is a large, lobed organ located in the upper abdomen of
            the human body, on the right side. It is the largest internal organ
            in the body and is responsible for a wide range of important
            functions.
          </p>

          <p class="one-of-the">
            One of the liver's main functions is to process and filter blood.
            The liver receives blood from two sources: the hepatic artery, which
            delivers oxygen-rich blood from the heart, and the portal vein,
            which delivers nutrient-rich blood from the digestive organs. The
            liver processes this blood and detoxifies it by removing harmful
            substances, such as alcohol, drugs, and toxins.
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line5">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="the-liver-also">
            The liver also plays a key role in metabolism. It helps to regulate
            the levels of sugar, protein, and fat in the blood, and it produces
            bile, which is a substance that helps to digest fats. The liver also
            stores glucose, which is a type of sugar that provides energy to the
            body, and it releases this glucose into the bloodstream when the
            body needs it.
